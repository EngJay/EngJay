### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Notable Accomplishments

- Crafted embedded software for safety-critical applications like
  battery-charging, traction, and vehicle control.
- Patched production embedded software to fix devices in the field.  
- Pioneered off-target unit testing for embedded software projects in two
  organizations.
- Led development and implamentation of CI workflows for embedded DevOps in two
organizations.


## Continuing Education

### *In-Progress*

- Work-Through[^1]:
[The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/)
([repo](https://github.com/EngJay/embedded-rust-book)).

  - Since the release of the pricing for the functional safety-certified version
  of Rust, Ferrocene, I anticipate the adoption of Rust for embedded and
  safety-critical appliction will accelerate. It seems far less costly for
  licensing, tooling, and process development than for safe C/C++.

[^1]: The term "work-through" is what I've come up with for instances of my
  practice of working through examples, books, tutorials, etc., to keep up with
  the software industry and continuously improve my skills and knowledge.

- Embedded Software Examples (private repo - ask for more info):

  - I've pioneered cross-platform embedded software development and off-target
  unit testing at two organizations but have been inspired by innovative
  engineers like [Phillip Johnston](https://github.com/phillipjohnston) of
  [Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/),
  [Jacob Beningo](https://www.beningo.com/), and John T. and Wayne T. Taylor of
  [Patterns in the Machine](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6440-9)
  to go much farther. This repo is an ongoing personal R & D
  project to develop and refine methods for cross-platform, -vendor, -compiler,
  -architecture, and even -language, development for crafting embedded software
  that better accomodates change than the current typical methods.
